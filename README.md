# speck eyewear Store Dashboard

## Purpose
I used React to create a dashboard for the store "*speck eyewear*". The dashboard is secured using Firebase authentication, with Toastify displaying login errors. If the user visits a page that does not exist, depending on their login state, the user will be redirected to the login page or the main dashboard area. I have now added nested routes that, once logged in, will take the user between viewing all products, adding a product, and editing a product. I have also provided an example of the product card. Users are now also able to add products to the database, but accessing the information will be added in a future update.
